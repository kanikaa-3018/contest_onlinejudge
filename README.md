## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanikaa-3018/contest_onlinejudge.git
cd contest_onlinejudge
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both `/server` and `/client`:

```env
# server/.env
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
RELEVANCE_AI_KEY=your_relevance_ai_key
```

```env
#client/.env
CF_API_KEY=your_codeforces_api_key
CF_SECRET=your_codeforces_secret
VITE_RELEVANCE_AI_KEY=your_relevance_ai_key
```

### 3. Install Backend & Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. (Recommended) Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> This will spin up the entire backend, including the **secure judge engine in containers**.

### 5. n8n Setup (AI Agents & Automation)
